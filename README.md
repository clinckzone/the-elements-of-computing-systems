# The-Elements-of-Computing-Systems
This repository contains the hdl implementations of all the chips projectwise.

## Project 1: Elementary Logic Gates
A typical computer architecture is based on a set of elementary logic gates like And, Or, Mux, etc., as well as their bit-wise versions And16, Or16, Mux16, etc. (assuming a 16-bit machine). This project is aimed at the construction of a typical set of basic logic gates. These gates form the elementary building blocks from which more complex chips will be later constructed.

## Project 2: Combinational Chips
The centerpiece of the computer's architecture is the CPU, or Central Processing Unit, and the centerpiece of the CPU is the ALU, or Arithmetic-Logic Unit. This project is aimed at gradually building a set of chips, culminating in the construction of the ALU chip of the Hack computer. All the chips built in this project are standard, except for the ALU itself, which differs from one computer architecture to another.
